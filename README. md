📘 Unit Traceability System

1. Project Overview
A web-based traceability system for PCB pairing (Station 1), with two user roles:

-Operator – inputs and edits unit data. (dashboard still in development).

-Admin – manages/oversees operations (dashboard still in development).

Data and authentication are handled by Firebase; app is deployed on Vercel.

| Role         | Email               | Password      |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| **Admin**    | `admin@mkff.com`    | `admin123`    |
| **Operator** | `operator@mkff.com` | `operator123` |

These are stored in Firebase Authentication and should be manually created in your Firebase Console → Authentication → Users.

admin-dashboard.html (Admin Interface)
-(Planned for implementation)
-Suggested features:

View all units across stations.
Filter by status, station, or date.
Export data (CSV/PDF).
Manage user accounts.

 -Firebase Integration
Authentication: Firebase Email/Password Auth is used to log in as either an admin or operator.
Realtime Database: All unit data is stored and retrieved from Firebase under the units/ path.

// Sample database rules for development
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}


Firebase is initialized in all HTML files using the following SDKs:
